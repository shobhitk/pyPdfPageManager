You can move the pages between different documents and re-order the pages either by typing the page number, clicking on up and down arrow on the page number field or by selecting a page and pressing Shift + UP or Shift + Down to move the pages. If you want to remove a page entirely, you can move those pages to `__UNDOCUMENTED__` and those pages will not be exported. You can also rename the document by double-clicking on the document item. Once you are happy with the page config, you can specify the folder and clicking on generate will generate all the pdf files within that folder.

Hope you all like it and please report any bugs you encounter.

Thanks
